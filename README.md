Well, Hi!
A little useless backstory lol.

So I woke up and @AndryX19 told me about his Hackintosh. 
After many Attempts and 2 successful ones, I was interested in redo it, but this time in Opencore. 
I asked him what SSD I should buy and he send me a link. I was like okay, its not that expensive, lets go.
I bought it and it was at my home the next day. 
I inserted the SSD and started working on my EFI, (OH BOI)

This took so long and I got angry and all. It didn't booted with a recovery image. Neither it did with a official image downloaded with a real Mac. I was sad and searched in all forums lol. But suddenly, out of nothing I got to a German post, that I totally understood. I changed one thing (DevirtualiseMmio to false) AND IT FINALLY BOOTED. 

In this time I got into a group on TG. There I met @dreamwhite who helped me improving my EFI. It was gone fast and it started working so great from there on. Now I have a fully working Hackintosh with all things working.

My setup
MB: Gigabyte H97-D3H 
CPU: Xeon 1231V3
Graphics: RX590 8GB

Thanks for helping and reading
